High-Throughput Microvolume Extraction Method

## Lab Protocol
### Introduction

High-throughput Microvolume Extraction (HiMEx) methods were tested using:
- Physical extraction through thermal shock (freeze-thaw, FT),
- Combination of physical and chemical extraction (FT + proteinase K, FTP),
- Further enhanced disruption with surfactant (FTP + IGEPAL, FTPIG).

## Abstract

**From Microscale to Microbial Insights: Validating High-Throughput Microvolume Extraction Methods (HiMEx) for Marine Microbial Ecology**

Extracting and amplifying DNA from small-volume, low-biomass samples enables rapid, ultra high-throughput analyses, and facilitates studying microbial communities where large-volume sample collection is challenging. This method can aid where â€˜conventionalâ€™ filtration-based methods miss capturing smaller microbes, or where microscale variability matters, such as the ocean. Here, we develop and validate physical and chemical-based DNA extractions from microvolumes with universal rRNA gene amplicons and metagenomic sequencing for all domains and viruses, on natural seawater and experimentally manipulated marine waters. Compared to 500-mL filter-based extraction, direct PCR of 3 Î¼L of lysed microvolume samples consistently captured comparable microbial community composition and diversity, with reliable amplification and little to no contamination. Metagenomic results of 10 Î¼L of lysed microvolume samples captured high-quality assemblies, bacterial genomes, and diversity on par or better than our conventional extraction (48 vs 44 representative MAGs), and substantially more putative complete circular viral genomes (38 vs 1). Our approach enables processing hundreds of samples in per day for a fraction of the cost of conventional methods and complements existing microvolume approaches by increasing throughput and removing unnecessary expenses, like excess plasticware and expensive bead clean-up, expanding opportunities for more comprehensive microbial community monitoring, controlled laboratory experiments and field-based investigations.
